The Flask Status Extension is a simple Flask extension that adds a status ping route to your Flask application. It allows you to easily check the health and status of your application or services by accessing a designated endpoint.

## Features

- **Status Endpoint**: Adds a `/api/status` endpoint to your Flask application.
- **Custom Status Message**(coming soon): Set a custom status message to provide more specific information about the health of your application.
- **Logging**(coming soon): Logs incoming requests to the status endpoint and changes to the custom status message for monitoring purposes.

## Installation

To install the Flask Status Extension, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask-status
```

## Usage

Here's how to use the Flask-Status extension in your Flask application

- Install the package using pip

- create a file `main.py`

- Add the following to `main.py`

```python

from flask_status import FlaskStatus

app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskStatus(app, url="/api/status")

if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```
